## Expressions

You define the most original abstract entity you could up with, `x`

You claim, _I shall now call this a **Variable**_. 
Thoroughly impressed, you think, _What next?_ 

_Let me create more variables. They shall be my new friends_, you state sadly

`x`, `y`, `z`

But you encounter your first hurdle. What if you wanted to pass on `x` to `y`, `y` to `z` and so on? _Surely I am not going to spend the rest of my days creating every possible value! I need a way to reuse what I have created_

So you define your first formalism:
> `x` applied to `y` is equivalent to saying `x = y`
<br/>
> Let `xy` be a shorthand notation to denote the same

You are puzzled by the next dilemma. _This is so boring, I'm just passing around things that already exist. I need a way to create things_. 

You are burdened with hunger with all this abstract thought. You start boiling some water, add some berries and vegetables to the pot and start stirring it. You notice the colour of the water changing from clear to the sickly shade your brew is turning into. At that moment it hits you that the solution has been right in front of you.

_Aha! I started with raw berries. The process of stirring and boiled turned them into a pulpy mess. I managed to transform something_
